Ever played mediumcore? No? Well, you might give this niche gamemode a try!
If you ever die, don't worry. With this mod, when you go to the place of your death and pick up your items, they ALL will return to their original place in your inventory.
It also works in multiplayer! This mod even adds an button/hotkey to toggle the ability to pick up another players items, in case you all die in one place.
There is also an option to make your dropped items glow.

FAQ:
Q: Does this mod support custom item slots from another mod?
A: No.

Q: Does this mod work with non-equippable items as well?
A: Yes.

Q: What happens if you have new items in the slots your old items were in?
A: New items are moved to another slot or dropped into the world (But if they are favorited and old items aren't, they stay).

Q: Does this mod keep track of the items when you die multiple times?
A: Yes. Old items take priority over new ones.


Sometimes hotkeys may not be assigned and you will have to assign them manually.
If you encounter any bugs, like losing all your items or a duplication scheme, report them in the Steam page or GitHub page of this mod.
