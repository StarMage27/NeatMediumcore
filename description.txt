Ever played mediumcore? No? Well, you might give this niche gamemode a try!
If you ever die, don't worry. With this mod, when you go to the place of your death and pick up your items, they all will return to their original place in your inventory.
It also works in multiplayer! This mod even adds an button/hotkey to toggle the ability to pick up another players items, in case you all die in one place.
There is also an option to make your dropped items glow.

Sometimes hotkeys may not be assigned and you will have to assign them manually.
If another mod adds a custom item slot, this mod likely doesn't support it.

If you encounter any bugs, like losing all your items or a duplication scheme, report them in the Steam page or GitHub page of this mod.
Many thanks to the Discord community of tModLoader for their help in creation of this mod.
